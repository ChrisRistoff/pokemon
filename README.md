- #### There is a roster of 8 pokemons to choose from.

- #### The game will ask you to select a pokemon from your belt to fight with.
- #### After you select your pokemon, the game will ask your friend to select a pokemon from their belt.
- #### You will have the option to attack or skip your turn.
- #### If you choose to attack, you will have an option to select an attack from your pokemon's moves.
- #### Each move does a different amount of damage and costs a different amount of energy.
